Erratas

So, one of the early people to leave hints that they were freaked out about Erratas was an early YouTuber making those old dinosaur tribute videos to the tune of whatever early 00s rock song struck their fancy. You know the type. "Tribute to Jurassic Park T-rex" and the song is "Animal I Have Become" by Skillet or something like that. This guy made those at first, but was leaving hints to Erratas. Eventually, he full on made a video about it. It's thought that he was connected to other groups who were talking about it at the time, but this innocent little JP-themed channel dropping creepy hints about a program that tracks and catalogues your every move is one of the major components that got the story on it's feet.
